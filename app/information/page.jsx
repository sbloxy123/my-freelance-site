              Next.js uses optimized pages which require no server-side
              computation, and can be instantly streamed to the end-user from
              multiple locations. The result is an ultra fast loading experience
              for your users.

              Basically it loads only critical parts of the page, exactly when
              the visitor needs it, and not a second sooner. Once loaded,
              Next.js prefetches resources for other pages so that clicking on
              the site feels buttery smooth and responsive. Everything is
              statically generated at runtime - so your site loads as fast as
              possible.

            <p className="">
              Unlike most traditional LAMP stack websites, the need for servers
              to perform logic and work whilst your visitors wait for the page
              to load is removed... which also ultimately removes the ways the
              website can be attacked by malicious code from hackers.
